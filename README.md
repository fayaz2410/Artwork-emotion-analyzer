# Image Captioning and Sentiment Analysis Web Application

This Flask web application generates captions for images and analyzes the sentiment of those captions using pre-trained models from Hugging Face. The application takes an image URL as input, generates a descriptive caption for the image, and then determines the emotional tone of the caption.

## Features

- **Image Captioning**: Generates descriptive captions for images using the BLIP model from Hugging Face.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the sentiment of the generated caption (Happy, Neutral, or Sad) using the CardiffNLP Twitter RoBERTa model.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: The user provides a URL of an image.
2. **Caption Generation**: The application sends the image to the Hugging Face BLIP model API, which returns a descriptive caption.
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: The caption is analyzed using the Hugging Face sentiment analysis model, which returns the most likely emotion.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- A Hugging Face API key

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fayaz2410/Artwork-analyzer.git
   cd Artwork-analyzer

2. **Download Pre-trained Models**

The application uses pre-trained models for image captioning and sentiment analysis, which are loaded locally. Download and save the models in the following directories:

Image Captioning Model: blip-image-captioning-large

Sentiment Analysis Model: twitter-roberta-base-sentiment

You can download these models from the Hugging Face Model Hub or another source and place them in the appropriate directories.You follow thw steps in the file "load and save model" for downloding models.

3. **Update Model Directories**

Modify the captioning_model_directory and sentiment_model_directory paths in app.py to point to the local directories where the models are saved.

4. **Run the Application**

Start the Flask server by running:

python app.py

The application will be accessible at http://localhost:5000 by default.

5. **Usage**
   
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5000.

Enter the URL of the image you want to analyze.

Submit the form to get a caption for the image and the sentiment of the caption.

7. **Files**
   
app.py: The main Flask application script.

templates/index.html: The HTML template for the web interface.

8. **Contributing**
